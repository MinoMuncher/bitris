# bitris

Rust crate for Tetris research, the board is defined by bits. it means that bitris has no colors. instead, it runs faster and with less memory.

This repository is still in the alpha version. Therefore, the interface is still unstable.

The current goal is to reimplement some commands from https://github.com/knewjade/solution-finder in Rust.
We plan to integrate some of the components created in the process.

Eventually, we plan to make documentation and samples available to users.
